# OpenAI Encrypted Reasoning Content: How It Helps

## The Core Problem

**Reasoning models** (like `o4-mini`, `o3`) work by generating internal "reasoning tokens" - their step-by-step thought process before producing the final answer. Normally, these reasoning tokens are:
- **Discarded after each turn** in regular conversations
- **Only exposed as summaries** for safety reasons
- **Lost between API calls** in stateless mode

## Why This Matters

### 1. Tool Use & Function Calling
When models need to call functions/tools, they require access to their previous reasoning to:
- **Maintain context** about why they made certain decisions
- **Build upon previous analysis** when processing function results
- **Avoid re-reasoning** the same problems

### 2. Zero Data Retention (ZDR) Compliance
Organizations with strict data policies cannot use `store=true` (stateful mode). Encrypted reasoning allows them to:
- **Keep workflows stateless** (`store=false`)
- **Maintain reasoning continuity** without server-side storage
- **Meet compliance requirements** while preserving intelligence

## How Encrypted Content Works

```json
{
  "encrypted_content": "gAAAAABotH7Yrg3YMUShB2lTK-jFfjGdr4Qxbs5DxHBT9vs2ZSu6Mi..."
}
```

This encrypted blob contains:
- **The model's internal reasoning state**
- **Step-by-step thought process** from previous turns
- **Context about decisions made** and why

## Key Benefits

### 1. Higher Intelligence
- Model can **build upon previous reasoning** instead of starting fresh
- **Maintains complex thought chains** across multiple turns
- **Better decision-making** with full context

### 2. Lower Costs
- **Avoids re-reasoning** the same problems
- **Reduces redundant processing**
- **More efficient token usage**

### 3. Better Performance
- **Faster responses** (no need to re-derive previous conclusions)
- **More coherent conversations**
- **Improved tool use accuracy**

## Implementation Example

### Initial Request
```json
{
  "model": "o4-mini",
  "input": "Explain why is the sky blue",
  "include": ["reasoning.encrypted_content"],
  "reasoning": {"effort": "low"},
  "stream": false,
  "store": false
}
```

### Follow-up Request (with encrypted reasoning)
```json
{
  "model": "o4-mini",
  "input": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Explain why is the sky blue"
    },
    {
      "type": "reasoning",
      "encrypted_content": "gAAAAABotH7Yrg3YMUShB2lTK-jFfjGdr4Qxbs5DxHBT9vs2ZSu6Mi...",
      "summary": []
    },
    {
      "type": "message",
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [{"type": "output_text", "text": "Previous detailed explanation..."}]
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Can you summarize it in one sentence?"
    }
  ],
  "include": ["reasoning.encrypted_content"],
  "reasoning": {"effort": "low"},
  "stream": false,
  "store": false
}
```

## Real-World Impact

**Without encrypted reasoning**: The model would need to re-analyze "why the sky is blue" from scratch when asked to summarize.

**With encrypted reasoning**: The model has access to its previous detailed analysis and can efficiently create a summary based on that reasoning.

## Security & Privacy

- **Client-side storage**: Encrypted content is stored entirely on your side
- **In-memory decryption**: OpenAI decrypts in-memory, never writes to disk
- **Immediate re-encryption**: New reasoning is encrypted and returned immediately
- **No persistence**: No intermediate state is ever stored server-side

## Use Cases

1. **Multi-step workflows** requiring reasoning continuity
2. **Tool/function calling** scenarios
3. **ZDR compliance** organizations
4. **Cost optimization** for complex reasoning tasks
5. **Performance improvement** in conversational AI

The encrypted content essentially acts as the model's "memory" of its thought process, allowing it to maintain intelligence and context across stateless API calls while meeting strict data retention requirements.
