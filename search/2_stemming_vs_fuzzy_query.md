# Stemming vs Fuzzy Query

## Stemming
Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root or base form. For example, the words "running", "runner", and "ran" can all be reduced to the root word "run". Stemming is useful in search engines because it allows for matching different forms of a word, increasing the chances of finding relevant documents.

## Fuzzy Query
A fuzzy query, on the other hand, is a search technique that allows for approximate matching of terms. It is useful when dealing with misspellings, typos, or variations in word forms. For example, a fuzzy query for the term "color" might also return results for "colour" or "colr".
