# AI Agent Orchestration Patterns

## 🤝 Why Use Multiple Agents?

Instead of one big “super agent” that tries to do everything:

- **Specialization** – Each agent can focus on what it’s best at.
- **Scalability** – Add or change agents easily.
- **Maintainability** – Easier to test and fix.
- **Optimization** – Different models and tools for different tasks.

## 🧩 Common Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Sequential Orchestration

Agents work one after another — like an assembly line. Each step refines the previous result.

> **Use when:**
> - The process has a clear order.
> - Each step depends on the last one.

> **Avoid when:**
> - Steps can be done in parallel.
> - The flow needs backtracking or iteration.

**Example:**
```
Creating a legal document:
Template Selector → Clause Customizer → Compliance Checker → Risk Assessor
```


### 2. Concurrent Orchestration

Agents work in parallel on the same input. Results are then combined.

> **Use when:**
> - You want different perspectives at once.
> - Speed and diversity matter (e.g., financial analysis).

> **Avoid when:**
> - Agents depend on each other’s output.
> - Shared state could cause conflicts.

**Example:**
```
Stock analysis:
Fundamental Agent + Technical Agent + Sentiment Agent + ESG Agent
```


### 3. Group Chat Orchestration

Agents discuss the problem together in a shared chat. A “chat manager” decides who talks next.

> **Use when:**
> - Brainstorming, debating, or quality checking.
> - Collaboration with humans.

> **Avoid when:**
> - Tasks are simple or strictly sequential.
> - No clear rule for “when done.”

**Example:**
```
City planning discussion:
Environmental Agent + Budget Agent + Community Agent debate before approval
```


### 4. Handoff Orchestration

Agents pass the task between them dynamically. Each decides if it should continue or hand it over.

> **Use when:**
> - The right agent isn’t known upfront.
> - Task complexity appears gradually.

> **Avoid when:**
> - Workflow is always fixed or simple.
> - Too many handoffs cause loops or confusion.

**Example:**
```
Customer support:
Triage Agent → Billing Agent → Technical Agent → Human support
```


### 5. Magentic Orchestration

(Think “Magnetic One”)
Used for open-ended, evolving problems with no clear plan. A manager agent builds and updates a task ledger dynamically as it learns.

> **Use when:**
> - The solution path is unknown.
> - Agents can act on real systems (use tools).
> - A step-by-step plan is needed for audit or review.

> **Avoid when:**
> - Tasks are simple or time-sensitive.
> - You already know the full workflow.

**Example:**
```
SRE automation for incident response:
Manager Agent builds a dynamic recovery plan by talking to diagnostic, infra, and communication agents
```


## ⚙️ Key Design Considerations

- **Single-agent vs Multi-agent:** Sometimes one well-equipped agent is enough.
- **Routing:** Decide whether to hardcode flows or let agents choose.
- **Context Window:** Pass only the necessary information.
- **Reliability:** Add retries, isolation, and circuit breakers.
- **Security:** Use least privilege, authentication, and audit trails.
- **Observability:** Log handoffs, monitor agents, and test workflows.


## 🚫 Common Mistakes

- Using complex orchestration for simple tasks.
- Overlapping agent roles.
- Ignoring latency or concurrency issues.
- Sharing mutable data between agents.
- Picking the wrong pattern (deterministic vs nondeterministic).


## 🔄 Combining Patterns

You can mix patterns!

**Example:**
```
Sequential → Concurrent → Group Chat
```
Each stage uses what fits best.


## 🧰 Implementation Options

- **Microsoft Agent Framework SDK**
	- Supports Sequential, Concurrent, Handoff, and Magentic orchestration.
- **Semantic Kernel SDK**
	- Supports Sequential, Concurrent, Group Chat, and Handoff.
- **Azure AI Foundry**
	- Offers no-code connected agents for simpler, nondeterministic workflows.


## 🧑‍💻 In Short

AI agent orchestration = Designing how smart agents work together.

It’s like managing a team:
- Some work in sequence
- Some in parallel
- Some discuss
- Some handoff
- And some plan dynamically

> **Note:** Pick your pattern wisely — the right orchestration makes your AI system scalable, explainable, and reliable.
